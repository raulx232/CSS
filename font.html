            Baby, baby
            There will always be a space for you and me
            Right where you left it
            And just maybe
            Enough time will pass
            We'll look back and laugh
            Just don't forget it

            And maybe I'm wrong
            For writing this song
            Losing my head over you</pre>

            And I'll be here
            'Cause we both know how it goes
            I don't want things to change
            I pray they stay the same always
            And I don't care
            If you're with somebody else
            I'll give you time and space
            Just know I'm not a phase
            I'm always, ways, ways
            Always, ways, ways
            I'm always, ways, ways

            Pretty lady, used to walk with me
            Down Bloor street, oh, what a time
            And I still remember the fussin', the fightin', the fuckin', the lyin'
            It's all fine, you'll always be mine

            And maybe I'm wrong (hey, babe, you could)
            For writing this song (write me a song)
            Losing my head over you</pre>

            <pre class="lyrics">
            And I'll be here

            Always, ways, ways
            I'm always, ways, ways

            Always, can count on it sure as the stars in the sky
            Always, you can count on it sure as the stars in the sky
            Always, my love for you ain't goin' nowhere
            Always, I will be here
